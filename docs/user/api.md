# API User Guide

The Playbook Partnership API allows you to construct workflows via a REST API. Workflows are specified using a JSON serialized DSL, they are then registered into the database and either the output can be resolved or the resulting playbook can be visited.

```python
import requests

# The playbook partnership endpoint to query
ENDPOINT = 'https://playbook-workflow-builder.cloud'
# ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000

# Construct a workflow Gene => GTEx Tissue => Barplot with the input: ACE2
gene = 'ACE2'
res = requests.post(ENDPOINT + '/api/db/fpl', json={
  "workflow": [
    {"id":"1","type":"Input[Gene]","data":{"type":"Term[Gene]","value":gene}},
    {"id":"2","type":"GTExTissueExpressionFromGene","inputs":{"gene":{"id":"1"}}},
    {"id":"3","type":"BarplotFrom[Scored[Tissue]]","inputs":{"terms":{"id":"2"}}}
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "title": "GTEx Tissue Expression Barplot"
  }
})
print(ENDPOINT + '/report/' + res.json())

# Construct a workflow FileInput => AnnDataFromFile => Limma-Voom with the example.h5ad file
res = requests.post(ENDPOINT + '/api/db/fpl', json={
  "workflow": [
    {"id": "0", "type": "FileInput", "data": { "type": "FileURL", "value": { "url": ENDPOINT + '/api/v1/components/core/file/example.h5ad', "filename": "example.h5ad" } } },
    {"id": "1", "type": "AnnDataFromFile", "inputs": { "file": { "id": "0" } } },
    {"id": "2", "type": "Limma-Voom", "inputs": { "anndata": { "id": "1" } } }
  ]
})
print(ENDPOINT + '/graph/' + res.json())

# Upload file for FileInput workflow
API_KEY = ''
# fetch example file
import pathlib
if not pathlib.Path('example.tsv').exists():
  import urllib.request
  urllib.request.urlretrieve(ENDPOINT + '/api/v1/components/core/file/example.tsv', filename='example.tsv')

# upload file
with open('example.tsv', 'r') as fr:
  res = requests.post(
    ENDPOINT + '/api/v1/components/core/file/upload',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Token '+API_KEY},
    files=dict(file=('example.tsv', fr)),
  )
file = res.json()['file'][0]

# use uploaded file as input to workflow
res = requests.post(ENDPOINT + '/api/db/fpl', json={
  "workflow": [
    {"id": "0", "type": "FileInput", "data": { "type": "FileURL", "value": file } },
    {"id": "1", "type": "GeneCountMatrixFromFile", "inputs": { "file": { "id": "0" } } }
  ]
})
print(ENDPOINT + '/graph/' + res.json())
```

Both of these examples will return an `id` for the workflow. This id can be used as follows:
- `https://playbook-workflow-builder.cloud/graph/{id}` => The graph mode of the workflow
- `https://playbook-workflow-builder.cloud/report/{id}` => The report mode of the workflow
- `https://playbook-workflow-builder.cloud/api/db/fpl/{id}` => See the resulting workflow as registered in the db
- `https://playbook-workflow-builder.cloud/api/db/fpl/{id}/output` => See the resulting workflow along with its output (for all nodes)

Each process (step of the workflow) can be accessed independently, those ids are at `[{"id": "fpl_id", "process": { "id": "{process_id}", ... }, ... }]` and can be accessed like:
- `https://playbook-workflow-builder.cloud/api/db/process/{id}` => See the resulting process as registered in the db
- `https://playbook-workflow-builder.cloud/api/db/process/{id}/output` => See the resulting process along with its output (for all nodes)
