# Playbook Workflow Builder User Guide

The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Playbook Partnership Workflow Builder (PPWB) is a web-based platform that facilitates knowledge resolution by enabling users to traverse an ever-growing network of input datasets, semantically annotated API endpoints, and data visualization tools contributed by the ecosystem. Via a user-friendly web-based user interface, workflows can be constructed from these building-blocks without technical expertise.
