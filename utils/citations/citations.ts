Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013; Kuleshov et al., 2016) is a gene set search engine that enables the querying of hundreds of thousands of annotated gene sets. Enrichr uniquely integrates knowledge from many high‐profile projects to provide synthesized information about mammalian genes and gene sets. The platform provides various methods to compute gene set enrichment, and the results are visualized in several interactive ways. This protocol provides a summary of the key features of Enrichr, which include using Enrichr programmatically and embedding an Enrichr button on any website. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 1</jats:bold>: Analyzing lists of differentially expressed genes from transcriptomics, proteomics and phosphoproteomics, GWAS studies, or other experimental studies</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 2</jats:bold>: Searching Enrichr by a single gene or key search term</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 3</jats:bold>: Preparing raw or processed RNA‐seq data through BioJupies in preparation for Enrichr analysis</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 4</jats:bold>: Analyzing gene sets for model organisms using modEnrichr</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 5</jats:bold>: Using Enrichr in Geneshot</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 6</jats:bold>: Using Enrichr in ARCHS4</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 7</jats:bold>: Using the enrichment analysis visualization Appyter to visualize Enrichr results</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 8</jats:bold>: Using the Enrichr API</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Basic Protocol 9</jats:bold>: Adding an Enrichr button to a website</jats:p>}, number={3}, journal={Current Protocols}, publisher={Wiley}, author={Xie, Zhuorui and Bailey, Allison and Kuleshov, Maxim V. and Clarke, Daniel J.

Machine learning (ML) is a promising strategy for predicting the BBB permeability, but existing studies have been limited by small datasets with limited chemical diversity. To mitigate this issue, we present a large benchmark dataset, B3DB, complied from 50 published resources and categorized based on experimental uncertainty.

However, it is susceptible to class-effect proportion effects (the proportion of class-correlated variables in a dataset) and batch effects (the presence of potentially confounding technical variation) when applied blindly on whole data sets, resulting in higher false-positive and false-negative rates. We evaluate five strategies for performing quantile normalization, and demonstrate that good performance in terms of batch-effect correction and statistical feature selection can be readily achieved by first splitting data by sample class-labels before performing quantile normalization independently on each split (“Class-specific”). Via simulations with both real and simulated batch effects, we demonstrate that the “Class-specific” strategy (and others relying on similar principles) readily outperform whole-data quantile normalization, and is robust-preserving useful signals even during the combined analysis of separately-normalized datasets. Quantile normalization is a commonly used procedure. But when carelessly applied on whole datasets without first considering class-effect proportion and batch effects, can result in poor performance. If quantile normalization must be used, then we recommend using the “Class-specific” strategy.</jats:p>}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Reports}, publisher={Springer Science and Business Media LLC}, author={Zhao, Yaxing and Wong, Limsoon and Goh, Wilson Wen Bin}, year={2020}, month=sep, language={en} "}},

By processing, abstracting and aggregating information from these resources into drug set libraries, knowledge about novel properties of drugs and small molecules can be systematically imputed with machine learning. In addition, drug set libraries can be used as the underlying database for drug set enrichment analysis. Here, we present Drugmonizome, a database with a search engine for querying annotated sets of drugs and small molecules for performing drug set enrichment analysis. Utilizing the data within Drugmonizome, we also developed Drugmonizome-ML. Drugmonizome-ML enables users to construct customized machine learning pipelines using the drug set libraries from Drugmonizome. To demonstrate the utility of Drugmonizome, drug sets from 12 independent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro screens were subjected to consensus enrichment analysis. Despite the low overlap among these 12 independent in vitro screens, we identified common biological processes critical for blocking viral replication. To demonstrate Drugmonizome-ML, we constructed a machine learning pipeline to predict whether approved and preclinical drugs may induce peripheral neuropathy as a potential side effect.

Through a simple web interface, Geneshot enables researchers to enter arbitrary search terms, to receive ranked lists of genes relevant to the search terms. Returned ranked gene lists contain genes that were previously published in association with the search terms, as well as genes predicted to be associated with the terms based on data integration from multiple sources. The search results are presented with interactive visualizations. To predict gene function, Geneshot utilizes gene–gene similarity matrices from processed RNA-seq data, or from gene–gene co-occurrence data obtained from multiple sources.

The ChEA3 background database contains a collection of gene set libraries generated from multiple sources including TF–gene co-expression from RNA-seq studies, TF–target associations from ChIP-seq experiments, and TF–gene co-occurrence computed from crowd-submitted gene lists. Enrichment results from these distinct sources are integrated to generate a composite rank that improves the prediction of the correct upstream TF compared to ranks produced by individual libraries. We compare ChEA3 with existing TF prediction tools and show that ChEA3 performs better.

In total, there are currently over 3 million available L1000 profiles. Such a dataset is invaluable for the discovery of drug and target candidates and for inferring mechanisms of action for small molecules. The L1000 assay only measures the mRNA expression of 978 landmark genes while 11,350 additional genes are computationally reliably inferred. The lack of full genome coverage limits knowledge discovery for half of the human protein coding genes, and the potential for integration with other transcriptomics profiling data. Here we present a Deep Learning two-step model that transforms L1000 profiles to RNA-seq-like profiles. The input to the model are the measured 978 landmark genes while the output is a vector of 23,614 RNA-seq-like gene expression profiles. The model first transforms the landmark genes into RNA-seq-like 978 gene profiles using a modified CycleGAN model applied to unpaired data. The transformed 978 RNA-seq-like landmark genes are then extrapolated into the full genome space with a fully connected neural network model. The two-step model achieves 0.914 Pearson’s correlation coefficients and 1.167 root mean square errors when tested on a published paired L1000/RNA-seq dataset produced by the LINCS and GTEx programs. The processed RNA-seq-like profiles are made available for download, signature search, and gene centric reverse search with unique case studies.</jats:p>}, number={1}, journal={BMC Bioinformatics}, publisher={Springer Science and Business Media LLC}, author={Jeon, Minji and Xie, Zhuorui and Evangelista, John E. and Wojciechowicz, Megan L. and Clarke, Daniel J.
